Application Purpose
===================

The purpose of the **Library Route Finder** is to make the retrieval of items
in the library. The deployment our team maintains (available
`here <https://route-finder.netlify.app>`_) uses the floor plans of
`Preus Library <https://luther.edu/library>`_ at Luther College for the purpose
of demonstration. Our stated goals for this project include improving the
experience of locating library materials, as well as minimizing distance
to walk if a patron or employee is visiting many shelves.

In addition to seeking to improve these real-world use cases in the realm
of library patron experience, we also envisioned this project as implementing
a portable concept. The idea of making the location of items within a library,
store, warehouse, etc. has positive potential for a wide range of people in the
areas of accessibility, orientation, and efficiency.

Getting Started
===============

Logging In
----------

The first step in using this program is to enter your name (or a username
of your choice) into the form on the home page:

Searching for a Book to Add
---------------------------

When you click "Log In" on the first page, you will be redirected to the Search
page. On this page is a form similar to the Login form, this time requesting an
ISBN (International Standard Book Number).

To add a book, simply enter its ISBN in the box provided, and click "Search".
The text below this button will update with a message indicating what book was
added to your list, or in the case of an error will communicate the issue.

Viewing the Booklist and Route
------------------------------

To view your list of books as well as a map of which shelves you will have to
visit to retrieve them, visit the "List of Books" link in the navigation bar.
This will bring you to this page, where you will see your list outlined:

.. image:: images/route.png

Highlighted in dark blue are the shelves you should visit, while the light blue
shelves indicate ones to skip. Multiple books may be located on the same shelf,
especially for books on the same topic, so the number of highlighted shelves is
likely to differ from the number of items on your list.

**Clearing the List**

To clear your list of items, simply click or tap the red "Clear List" button.
This action cannot be undone, and you will have to return to the "Add Books"
page in order to re-locate any items.
