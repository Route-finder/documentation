Welcome to the Library Route Finder Documentation!
==================================================

The **Library Route Finder** is a web-based tool to assist in finding items in
Preus Library at Luther College. The application is composed of a React-based
frontend, as well as an API-based backend.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for technical information about the project,
and the :doc:`api` section for information about the API provided by the backend.
For contributing and community guidelines, please see :doc:`contributing`.

This project was developed as a Senior Project for the
`Luther College Computer Science department <https://www.luther.edu/computer-science/major/>`_.

The stated purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the process of
developing a software project from conception through development and testing and
to deployment of a final product.  In that spirit, our group aspires to use our
technical and organizational skills to create a web-based application which assists
users in locating books within a library, providing a visual map and route showing
both item locations and an efficient route to those items.
